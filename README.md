# Temperature-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
we have to find Delhi temperature using Linear regression model 


Normal Linear Regression Model is depend single independent variable but our model is having multiple independent features.

I have downloaded Delhi weather dataset form kaggle website.

This model mainly describe basic Linear regression process.

step 1:
load data set and pre processing

step 2:
visualization and data cleaning ( drop null value )

step 3:
feature selection 

step 4:

build Linear Regression Model using sklearn library.

step 5:

Evaluate the model using test dataset
Finally find the MSE,RMSE and Adjusted RSquare

Needed Libraries :
python = 3.6.2
sklearn =0.21.3
matplotlib =2.0.2
seaborn =0.8
numpy =1.17.4

Thanks for Reading
